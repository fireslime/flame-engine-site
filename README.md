# Flame engine Docs

This is the overall documentation of the Flame engine. You can find a more in depth doc regarding each element in the [API docs](https://flame-engine.org/API)

## A summary

Flame is a _modular_ game engine made on top of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). 

It provides a complete out-of-the-way solutions for games, taking advantage of the powerful infrastructure provided by Flutter but simplifying the code you need to build your projects.

It empowers you with a simple yet effective game loop implementation, and all the surrounding utilities you might need to use in a game: images, sprites, sprite sheets, animations, audio, input, components/object system, et cetera.

You can _pick and choose_ whichever parts you want, as they are all somewhat independent and modular.

We also support easy-to-use integrations with famous third parties and tools, like Riveapp, box2d, tiled, Google Play Games, gamepad support and more.

The engine and ecosystem is being constantly improved by the community, so please feel free to reach out, open issues, PRs and make suggestions. Give us a star if you want to help give the engine exposure and grow the community.
